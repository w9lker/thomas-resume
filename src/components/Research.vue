                        The research interests of <b>Jacob Thomas</b> focus on the the different aspects
                        of migration, as he tries to look at this phenomena from different perspectives.
                        He also explored the factors of this phenomena that have been unnoticed before, such as 
                        the reason why so many people want to migrate, but only a small portion of them mange to
                        do so in his book manuscript<i>Denial, Deterrence, and Disenchantment: Why Many Never Immigrate.</i> Additionaly he explores
                        <b>the impact of migration policies on international migration</b>, by comparing
                        the cases of different countries using a variety of tools. He also takes a closer look at Hong Kong, for which he was
                        awarded more than $70000 USD to research. He also recognizes the importance of knowing how
                    <b>media portrays immigrants</b> and how that narrative changed over the recent years. The latter area
                        of his research is the <b>migration policymaking</b>, taking into account concerns both of migrant-sending and
                        migrant-receiving countries. Apart from this phenomena, he also delves into many <b>contentious issues</b>, by 
                        conduccing research on public opinion, such as abortion, race and ethnicity.

                                who have the intention and the opportunity to immigrate to another

                                reasons behind this decision, and how it affects the lives and identities of these individuals and their 
                                families. He examines the cases of Chinese people who had the chance to immigrate to the United States, 
                                but chose to stay in China or return to China after a short period of time. He analyzes the <span>factors</span> that

                                <p>The research interests of <b>Jacob Thomas</b> focus on the <span>critical normative theories 
                                    about migration.</span> <b>Thomas</b> critically examines the assumptions and implications of the dominant normative 
                                    theories about migration, such as <span>cosmopolitanism, nationalism, liberalism, and communitarianism</span>, and how 
                                    they justify or criticize the existing migration policies and practices. He also proposes alternative normative
                                    theories that incorporate the concerns and interests of both migrant-sending and migrant-receiving countries, 
                                    such as the theory of reciprocal justice, the theory of global social justice, and the theory of democratic 
                                    inclusion. He analyzes the <span>ethical and political dilemmas and trade-offs</span> that arise from applying these theories
                                    to the real-world cases of migration, such as the refugee crisis, the brain drain, the integration of immigrants,
                                    and the rights of migrants</p>

                                investigates how the public perceives and evaluates the actions and 
                                policies of different countries and actors in the global arena, and 
                                how these opinions are influenced by various factors, such as the media,
                                the culture, the ideology, and the emotions. He examines the cases of 
                                various international relations and contentious issues, such as the 
                                <span>COVID-19 pandemic, the abortion debate, and the gun regulation debate,</span> 
                                and how they affect the attitudes and behaviors of the public in 
                                different countries, especially in the United States. He uses a range of methods and data, 
                                such as surveys, experiments, interviews, and content analysis, to provide a comprehensive and rigorous 
                                assessment of the public opinion research about international relations and contentious issues.</p>
