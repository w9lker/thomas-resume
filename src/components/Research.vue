                                <p>The research interests of <b>Jacob Thomas</b> focus on the phenomenon of 
                                <span>might-have-been-immigrants or potential immigrants</span>, who are people 
                                who have the intention and the opportunity to immigrate to another 
                                country, but ultimately decide not to do so. <b>Thomas</b> explores the 
                                reasons behind this decision, and how it affects the lives and identities of these individuals and their 
                                families. He examines the cases of Chinese people who had the chance to immigrate to the United States, 
                                but chose to stay in China or return to China after a short period of time. He analyzes the <span>factors</span> that 
                                influence this choice, such as the <span>legal, economic, social, and cultural</span> barriers and incentives for migration, 
                                the role of family ties and obligations, and the formation of a sense of belonging and attachment to a society.</p>
