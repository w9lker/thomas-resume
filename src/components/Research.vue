                        The research  of <b>Jacob Thomas</b> connects the fields of international migration control, inequality, and law by 
                        generating knowledge and theories about what ties people to their society and why we do not observe more international migration.
                        He focuses on how migration policies, bureaucracies, and social-cultural forces interact on multiple levels of society to prevent many 
                        from migrating internationally. His research encompasses how the behavior of bureaucrats and organizations in government change 
                        as they adopt and implement new policy changes, how those who migrate differ from those who do not (selectivity), and 
                        how policies and social-cultural forces structure migration behaviors and subjective orientations toward migration. 
                        
                        His main research aims to explain why despite widespread public perceptions that too many people are migrating, only a small fraction of those 
                        who would like to immigrate or travel to migrant-receiving countries in the end do so. He further explains heterogeneity in this 
                        might-have-been-immigrant population in migrant-sending societies that many demographers have tended to lump together 
                        by examining in detail three different mechanisms--denial, deterrence, and disenchantment--that lead many to never immigrate. 
                        Additionaly he explores <b>the impact of migration policies on international migration</b> both with focused case comparisons
                        (e.g., Australia, Canada, China, and the United States) with variety of methods, as well as large-N quantitative macro-analyses of 
                        all countries throughout decades of migratoin history. 
                        
                        With the support of a $67000 USD research grant he is currently surveying the population
                        of Hong Kong to better understand how those who emigrated are different those who considered/thought about migrating but have not yet done so
                        after the China's government imposed a National Security Law that criminalized all protest against China's government and required 
                        education to instill positive views in all school children toward China's government. 
                        He also assess how the way the <b>media represents </b> of immigrants and other controversial issues structures public attitudes 
                        toward social problems and phenomenon like abortion, gun control, and racial-ethnic prejudice in the United States.
                        He has developed several critical normative theories about international migration based upon extensive knowledge 
                        of positivist, empirical research about international migration.

                                <p>The primary focus of <b>Jacob Thomas'</b> research engages in both comparative and international analysis of
                                the <span>impact of migration policies on international migration and mobility in terms of the composition and volume of migrants and travelers.
                                He examines this general phenomenon in a diverse range of societies including Australia, Canada, China, and the United States, and also at the international macro-level
                                with quantitative data from nearly every country </span>. <b>
                                Thomas</b> examines how different forms of <span>policies</span>, such as <span>visa regimes, 
                                points systems, exit bans, and emigration controls,</span> affect the patterns authorized and unauthorized movement of migrants and travelers across borders
                                    and also the social forces that structure those visa policies.
                                His research draws on both quantitative and qualitative data to offer simultaneously provide both positivist and interpretivist insights about the
                                the similarities and differences between distinct types of might-have-been-immigrants and immigrants. He uses a range of methods and data,
                                including <span>formal mathematical modeling, computational text analysis, network analysis, historical documents, oral history methods,

                                        remote control, effectively transitioning to a period of very low migration era. 
                                        The new mode of remote control 1) brought more order and precision to the process 
                                        of individually evaluating prospective visitors; 2) enabling states to select and 
                                        defined authorized migrants according to their migratory purpose, and 3) reduced contact 
                                        between residents in migrant-receiving and prospective migrants in migrant-sending societies. 
                                        High migration returned after 1989, even as the system of remote control persisted.

                                the native-born population.</span> <b>Thomas</b> investigates how different forms
                                of communication, such as visual art, language, and social media,
                                shape and reflect the identities, experiences, and perceptions of migrants
                                and the host society. He examines the cases of various migrant groups, 
                                such as <span>undocumented immigrants, refugees, and expatriates</span>.
                                He analyzes the factors that influence the 
                                communication and media representations of migrants, such as the 
                            <span>political context, the cultural norms, and the psychological processes.</span> 
                                He also evaluates the consequences of the communication and media 
                                representations of migrants, such as the attitudes, emotions, and 
                                behaviors of the media producers and consumers. He uses a variety 
                                of methods and data, such as ethnographic observations, interviews,
                                experiments, and content analysis, to provide a rich and nuanced 
                                account of this important and timely phenomenon. With his coauthor Huang Peng
                                also methodologically analyzes the
                                benefits of drawing on complementary positionalities in qualitative field research and how it can augment

                                <p>Drawing on his own studies of political philosophy and theory, another strand of <b>Jacob Thomas'</b> 
                                    research synthesizes positivist empirical research on intenrational migration to build 
                                    <span>reflexive and critical normative theories 
                                    about how nation-states govern international migration and immigrants.</span> 
                                    For example, he has critically examined the assumptions and implications of canonical and influential normative 
                                    theories about migration, such as <span>cosmopolitanism, nationalism, liberalism, and communitarianism</span>, and how 
                                    they fail to address  the concerns of both migrant-receiving societies and migrant-sending societies, thereby perpetuating to
                                    migration flows that both societies find undesirable.
                                    Not stopping with a critique, he then proposes alternative framework that incorporates the input of different groups
                                    in both migrant-receiving and migrant-sending in generating a vision for a more just and truly international migration policy
                                    based on the inequality between countries and colonial and postcolonial histories of harm suffered.
                                    He also draws on interdisciplinary empirical studies of migrant acculturation to show how predominant and normative foundations of 
                                    accepted social science theories of immigrant acculturation/integration/assimilation overlook how these processes perpetuate and 
                                    exacerbate constitutive cultural problems of migrant-receiving societies. After providing a conceptual language to perceive
                                    these subtle forces, he then suggests ways in which minority groups provide inspiration for alternative progressive paths of
                                    acculturation into migrant-receiving society that helps them confront their pathologies.
