                    Between Beijing Foreign Studies University, UCLA, and CUHK, Jacob has taught a diverse range of students in
terms of age, culture, ethnicity, and class in distinct institutional contexts.HisMy general teaching objectives
are to have his students 1) connect what they learn in class to what they observe in society, 2) acquire tacit
knowledge through regular exercises in research methods, and 3) cultivate creative life-long habits of
educating the self and society throughout their personal and professional life. He succeeds in these objectives
whenever his students respectively describe observing examples of what he has taught them, become more
confident and resourceful in drawing upon the methods he introduced to them, and teach him or inspire him
with new research ideas.
